# Strings — Tying the music industry together

A **Phase 1 prototype** of Strings: a professional networking + discovery + marketplace platform for the **Indian music & live-event industry**. Built as a polished, client-only React (Vite) web app for the partner demo on **Saturday, 26 Sept 2026**.

> One verified profile, one feed of the opportunities that matter, and the daily news that keeps the industry moving — for performers, venues, buyers of talent, crew, and institutions.

---

## Run it

**Prerequisites:** Node 18+ and npm.

```bash
cd strings-web
npm install     # install dependencies
npm run dev     # local dev server (hot reload)
npm run build   # production build → dist/  (must pass cleanly)
npm run preview # preview the production build locally
```

The build is **fully static** — no server or backend required. Routing uses `HashRouter`, so the `dist/` output works on GitHub Pages (or any static host) with zero config. Serve the `dist/` folder as-is.

**Demo login:** click **“See it in action”** (or **Log in**) on the landing page for instant demo access as *Meera Iyer, Vocalist · Mumbai*. “Create your profile” walks a 3-step onboarding stepper, then also enters demo mode.

## 5-minute demo script (partner pitch)

> Goal: show the network → the marketplace intelligence → the trust layer → the roadmap.

**0:00 — The promise (Landing, `/`)**
Scroll the hero: live Gighub preview, stats, four layers, stakeholder chips, testimonials. Click **“See it in action.”**

**0:45 — Home (`/home`)**
Point out the star-story hero, then the **“Rising this week”** carousel (hover a card). Scroll the feed — like a post (persists), save one (toast fires).

**1:45 — Collab (`/collab`) — the money slide**
Hover an **AI Match Score** badge → “Why this matches” tooltip. Apply to an opportunity → toast + it appears under *Your applications*. Click **Post an opportunity** to show the composer.

**2:45 — Profile (`/profile/zoya`) — the trust slide**
Scroll the EPK hero (play the featured-clip waveform), trust badges, then the **availability calendar** — tap a free day. Switch to your own profile (`/profile/meera`) for the **gig-ready meter** and **analytics sparkline**.

**3:45 — Discovery (`⌘K`, `/news`, `/gighub`)**
Hit **⌘K** and type “guitar” — jump anywhere. Open **News**, open the star story, save it. Skim **Gighub**.

**4:30 — Close (`/live`, `/about`)**
`/live` shows the Phase 2 teaser + gig countdowns; `/about` shows the Phase 1→3 plan. End on: *“Network first, marketplace depth next, booking & live after — that’s the sequencing that beats the agency incumbents.”*

## Roadmap

- **Phase 2 — Marketplace & growth:** applicant review dashboard, subscriptions/billing, full profile analytics, dedicated search index, external social linking, advertising placements
- **Phase 3 — Services & monetisation depth:** structured booking workflow (budget → browse → availability → book), live streaming (the `/live` placeholder is the stub), artist management & broker services
- **Beyond:** the wider NAAD Infinity 360° ecosystem — OTT platform, ticketing e-commerce, production facilities, equipment rental, exhibitions, conferences, education academy

## Tech notes

- React 19 + Vite 8, `react-router-dom` (HashRouter), `lucide-react` icons only — no UI kit, no chart lib
- Single hand-rolled design system in `src/theme.css` (white & blue brand, Space Grotesk + Inter, light/dark tokens)
- `src/data/demo.js` — all content & the mock match/availability/analytics algorithms (deterministic, seeded)
- `src/store/store.jsx` — React context + `localStorage` persistence
- No backend, no git init, no deploy scripts — publishing is handled separately
